Raw sequencing processing procedures in High Performance Computing Clusters (HPCC)

For 16S Step1: run fastqc; Step2: trimmomatic; Step3: fastqc; Step4: Runthe automated batch script "GESTE_16S_Qiime.batch" to obtain OTU table

For shotgun metagenome: Please refer to the detailed step explanation in the Jupyter notebook "EHP_metagenome_shell_scripts.ipynb". Corresponding example batch script is attached starting with metagenome_xx.batch

Please note, all participants ID are de-identified. Path to file is encrypted as $path. When researchers run the code, please modify path and sample name.
